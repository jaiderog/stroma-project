# Research Data Governance Framework

## Overview

Project Stroma is an initiative focused on establishing a robust and comprehensive Research Data Governance (RDG) Framework. This framework aims to provide guidelines, policies, and best practices for managing research data throughout its lifecycle, from planning and collection to storage, sharing, and archiving.

## Why Research Data Governance?

In today's data-driven research landscape, effective data governance is crucial for:

*   **Ensuring Data Quality and Integrity:** Maintaining the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of research data.
*   **Promoting Data Sharing and Reusability:** Facilitating the ethical and efficient sharing of data to maximize its impact and avoid duplication of effort.
*   **Complying with Regulations and Ethics:** Adhering to legal, ethical, and institutional requirements for data handling, privacy, and security.
*   **Enhancing Research Reproducibility and Transparency:** Making research processes and outcomes more verifiable and understandable.
*   **Minimizing Risks:** Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.

## Key Components of the Framework (Under Development)

This framework will address several key areas, including but not limited to:

*   **Data Management Plans (DMPs):** Guidance on creating effective DMPs.
*   **Data Security and Privacy:** Policies and procedures for protecting sensitive data.
*   **Data Ownership and Access:** Defining roles, responsibilities, and access protocols.
*   **Data Archiving and Preservation:** Strategies for long-term data retention and accessibility.
*   **Metadata Standards:** Recommendations for consistent and descriptive metadata.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Guidelines for responsible data collection and use.
